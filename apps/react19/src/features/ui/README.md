## What goes inside this "ui" directory

This directory will contain all the "basic" components with their stylings: these will then be used inside every feature.\
Think about these as the minimum possible components that we can have, which will then be grouped together to form components of different features.

example of components that go in here:

- button
- generic card
- input for text
- ...
